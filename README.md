# Data Mining Final Project - README.md file

## GUI 
### Operating the GUI:
Set the Working Directory to the folder "ui" before running the application.

Ensure that you have PyQt5 and its related libraries installed, as well as have your Python application updated to the most recent version.
Check whether the "ui" folder has all the files necessary to run the GUI code.

Within the "ui" folder, run the file called "GUI_BR_PY.py" only to launch the GUI application.
